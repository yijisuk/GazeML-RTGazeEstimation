# GazeML-RTGazeEstimation
This software is designed to accurately track and analyze a driver's eye movements in real-time, leverages advanced computer vision and gaze estimation algorithms to determine the direction and focus of a driver's gaze. With its primary intention for integration within smart car cabins, the software aims to enhance driver safety and situational awareness by either alerting drivers or initiating appropriate countermeasures when their attention drifts away from the road.
